All notable changes to RustySNES are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial workspace scaffold (cycle-accurate emulator architecture, ported from RustyNES).
- Seeded `tests/roms/` with the permissive corpora — gilyon (MIT), undisbeliever (MIT/Zlib),
  and a deterministic SingleStepTests/spc700 (MIT) sample — plus the gitignored `external/`
  tier (65816, full spc700, 240p, Krom, blargg-spc). Curated the commercial-ROM coverage
  manifest (`tests/roms/commercial-corpus.json`) to popularity-weighted, genre-diverse beloved
  titles (metadata + SHA-256 only; no ROM bytes committed).
- **Phase 1 — CPU + golden oracle: the WDC 65C816 core passes the SingleStepTests/65816
  per-opcode oracle to 0-diff** on architectural state **and** per-instruction cycle count
  (5,119,999 / 5,120,000 = 100.00% across all 512 opcode files × 10,000 tests, native +
  emulation). All 256 opcodes × addressing modes, `REP`/`SEP` width changes, and `XCE`
  emulation/native transitions verified.

### Fixed

- `MVN`/`MVP` (block move): address now uses the full 16-bit `X`/`Y` regardless of index width
  and the increment respects the `X` flag (8-bit keeps the high byte); the `A.w` loop test is a
  post-decrement (ares `instructionBlockMove`). The oracle harness re-steps these looping
  instructions to the recorded cycle budget.
- `JSL`/`RTL`: stack access uses the full-16-bit `S` "new" push/pull (`pushN`/`pullN`) so it no
  longer corrupts `S` on an emulation-mode page wrap; the page-1 confinement is re-applied at
  the instruction boundary (ares `CallLong`/`instructionReturnLong`).

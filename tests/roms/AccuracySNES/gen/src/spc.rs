//! A tiny SPC700 assembler, for Group E (ticket **T-04-E**).
//!
//! # Why the cart needs one
//!
//! The SPC700 is a separate processor with its own RAM, and the only channel between it and the
//! 65816 is four bytes. Nothing about it is testable from the main CPU directly — so a Group E
//! test uploads a small SPC700 program through the IPL boot handshake, lets it run, and reads its
//! answers back through those same four ports. Writing those programs means emitting SPC700
//! machine code, and `ca65` does not assemble SPC700.
//!
//! # Deliberately minimal
//!
//! One function per instruction the tests actually use, rather than a table-driven assembler for
//! all 256 opcodes. An encoder is only trustworthy where it is exercised, and a mostly-unused
//! table is mostly-unverified — a wrong byte in it would surface as an emulator disagreement
//! rather than as an assembler bug, which is the most expensive way to find it. Every opcode here
//! is used by a committed test, and the pair of tests that read PSW back cover the encoding
//! end to end.
//!
//! Opcode values are from the SPC700 opcode map in `ref-docs/`; each is spelled out at its
//! emitter so a reader can check one without holding the whole map in mind.

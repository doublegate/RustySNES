# agy-review.sh -- headless GitHub PR reviewer driven by Antigravity CLI (`agy`).
#
# Runs on a SELF-HOSTED GitHub Actions runner that lives on a machine where `agy`
# is already logged in via Google OAuth. Because it uses the CLI's cached OAuth
# session (not an API key), every review is billed against your Google AI Ultra
# rate limits -- i.e. free under the subscription, no metered API spend.
#
# Flow: resolve PR -> `gh pr diff` -> build an adversarial-reviewer prompt
#       (+ repo style guide) -> `agy --print` under a PTY -> post via `gh pr comment`.
#
# See ../README.md for setup, the issue #76 PTY workaround, and the ToS caveat.

# author-association gate; see the trust model at the agy invocation below) is

# it is too large for the API. `refs/agy/*` are private namespaces (cannot clobber
# a real branch) and are removed on exit. Auth goes through `http.extraheader` for

You are an adversarial code reviewer doing a first-pass review of a GitHub pull request.
Act as a skeptical senior engineer, not the author. Be concise, specific, and honest.

Output (GitHub-flavored Markdown, no preamble):
1. A one-sentence summary of what the PR does.
2. "### Blocking issues" -- correctness, security, data-loss, or breaking-change
   problems only. Write "None found." if there are none.
3. "### Suggestions" -- non-blocking improvements; cite file and line where you can.
4. "### Nitpicks" -- optional, keep terse.
Do not praise. Focus on what could be wrong. If the change is trivial, say so briefly.

# agy-review.sh -- headless GitHub PR reviewer driven by Antigravity CLI (`agy`).
#
# Runs on a SELF-HOSTED GitHub Actions runner that lives on a machine where `agy`
# is already logged in via Google OAuth. Because it uses the CLI's cached OAuth
# session (not an API key), every review is billed against your Google AI Ultra
# rate limits -- i.e. free under the subscription, no metered API spend.
#
# Flow: resolve PR -> `gh pr diff` -> build an adversarial-reviewer prompt
#       (+ repo style guide) -> `agy --print` under a PTY -> post via `gh pr comment`.
#
# See ../README.md for setup, the issue #76 PTY workaround, and the ToS caveat.

# `log: command not found` under set -e instead of warning — a latent misconfiguration trap.)

# Guarding against a leak of agy's interactive Google OAuth login flow. When agy's cached
# session lapses on the runner, `--print` emits the login prompt (a live OAuth URL + "paste the
# authorization code here") instead of a review; that text is non-empty, so have_text() alone
# would treat it as a valid review and POST it — leaking the URL into a public PR comment (the
# incident this guards against).
#
# The guard keys on the ONE artifact that reliably distinguishes agy's login flow from any
# review: a live Google OAuth *authorization URL* (scheme + host + endpoint path). This choice
# is deliberate and is the convergence point of several rounds of agy's own adversarial review:
#   * It does NOT false-positive on reviewing the reviewer or on an OAuth-related PR. A code
#     review quotes this script's BARE regex ("accounts.google.com/o/oauth2", no scheme) or
#     discusses auth in prose; neither contains the "https://…/o/oauth2" URL form. (Earlier
#     signature/prompt-phrase heuristics wrongly flagged such reviews.)
#   * It needs NO "is this a review?" exemption, so it CANNOT be disarmed by a section header
#     (or the phrase "blocking issues") appearing in the same output as a URL — a false
#     NEGATIVE would be a leak. (Earlier "### Blocking issues" exemptions had exactly this hole,
#     and were also brittle to header case / trailing punctuation.)
# So this is both necessary (agy's login flow always prints the URL) and sufficient (nothing
# else legitimately carries a live authorization URL), with no heuristic that flips between
# false-positive and false-negative.
#
# The regex requires the scheme (`https?://`) and the host + `/o/oauth2` endpoint prefix, but
# deliberately NOT a trailing slash: agy round-4 flagged that a `.../o/oauth2/` requirement
# would miss a URL emitted as `.../o/oauth2?client_id=…` or bare `.../o/oauth2` (a leak). The
# scheme is what keeps a review's bare-pattern quote from matching, so dropping the trailing
# slash loses no safety.
OAUTH_URL_RE='https?://accounts\.google\.com/o/oauth2'

# The single guard, used at BOTH the retry-loop capture (Layer 1) and the assembled body before
# posting (Layer 3): true iff a text contains a live OAuth authorization URL. There is no
# separate heuristic and no "is this a review?" exemption — earlier a secondary "authentication
# failed or timed out" substring fallback was tried, but agy round-4 flagged it (correctly) as
# broad enough to abort a genuine review that merely discusses auth-timeout handling. The live
# URL is always present in a real login flow, so it alone is both necessary and sufficient; a
# lapse is detected AND a leak is blocked by the same unconditional check.

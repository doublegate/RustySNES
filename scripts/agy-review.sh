# agy-review.sh -- headless GitHub PR reviewer driven by Antigravity CLI (`agy`).
#
# Runs on a SELF-HOSTED GitHub Actions runner that lives on a machine where `agy`
# is already logged in via Google OAuth. Because it uses the CLI's cached OAuth
# session (not an API key), every review is billed against your Google AI Ultra
# rate limits -- i.e. free under the subscription, no metered API spend.
#
# Flow: resolve PR -> `gh pr diff` -> build an adversarial-reviewer prompt
#       (+ repo style guide) -> `agy --print` under a PTY -> post via `gh pr comment`.
#
# See ../README.md for setup, the issue #76 PTY workaround, and the ToS caveat.

# also refuses any diff over 20,000 lines with HTTP 406, and that is not an error

# does not widen the trust boundary the workflow already sets: whatever governs
# whether a given PR's diff is allowed to reach agy at all (the workflow `if:`
# author-association gate; see the trust model at the agy invocation below) is
# unchanged, and this only changes HOW an already-permitted diff is obtained when
# it is too large for the API. `refs/agy/*` are private namespaces (cannot clobber
# a real branch) and are removed on exit. Auth goes through `http.extraheader` for
# the one fetch rather than a persisted credential, so a `persist-credentials:
# false` checkout stays intact; a hand-run without GH_TOKEN falls through to git's

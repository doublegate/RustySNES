# agy-review-selftest.sh -- guards the comment-selection logic in `agy-review.sh`.
#
# Why this exists: that filter decides which PR comments the bot DELETES, and it has been wrong
# twice, both times invisibly.
#
#   1. The just-posted comment was not reliably excluded. `new_comment_id` came from re-querying
#      the comment list, which races GitHub's read replication; on a miss the exclusion became
#      `select(.id != null)`, true for every id, and the run deleted the review it had just
#      published.
#   2. jq's `--arg`/`--argjson` were handed to `gh api`, which has no such flags. It exited
#      non-zero, `2>/dev/null` hid the message, and `set -o pipefail` + `set -e` killed the script
#      AFTER posting — so stale comments silently accumulated and the job went red with nothing in
#      the log explaining why.
#
# Neither was catchable by looking at the review the bot posted: both times it posted fine. So the
# filter is tested here directly, offline, against fixtures — no network, no `gh`, no runner.
#
# Run: bash scripts/agy-review-selftest.sh
